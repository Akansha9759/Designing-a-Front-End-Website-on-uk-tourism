            <h3>Rafting</h3>
            <p>Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. 
                Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience.
                This activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, if not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14 feet (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles
                 or oars to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, or by the use of oars.
                Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. Rafting is also a competitive sport
                 practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting championship event between the participating nations. The International Rafting Federation, often referred to as the IRF, 
                 is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport.</p>

            <h3> Bungee jumping</h3>
            <p>The gorgeous hilly terrains are an intrinsic part of Uttarakhand, and cannot be extricated out of the Rishikesh experience. The bungee jumping location is about few minute walk from the serene land.
             Please note that the 15-20 minute walk up from the Recovery point, after your Bungy, to the Cafeteria, maybe strenuous for some, considering this is a hilly area but we urge you to take this in the spirit of Rishikesh adventure tour packages, 
             and come prepared with sports shoes.
            This is a beautiful walk up nonetheless, amidst the wilderness of Rishikesh, and rest assured that we have made arrangements to make Bungee 
            jumping places this as comfortable as possible, by providing 1 complementary bottle of water for the walk up, along with benches for a short rest, at regular intervals of the route. 
            The bungee jumping prices are affordable and blended with other sports to make it more cost-effective. You can choose any one from the combos as per your conveniences.</p>
